# Smart Demand Forecasting System for Retail Supply Chain

## Problem Statement

A national retail chain with hundreds of outlets across the country seeks a solution to optimize inventory management by forecasting item-level demand. The primary objectives are:

- Minimizing stockouts and overstock scenarios
- Enhancing supply chain logistics and planning
- Adjusting dynamically to external factors such as holidays, weather conditions, and promotional events

## Available Data Sources

Structured and semi-structured datasets are available to enable robust modeling:

### Internal Data
- **Historical Sales Data:** Daily item-level sales records per store
- **Store Metadata:** Location, type, floor space, local demographics
- **Promotions and Discounts:** Flags or timelines for campaigns and discounts

### External Data
- **Weather Data:** Temperature, rainfall, extreme conditions
- **Holiday Calendars:** Regional and national holidays
- **Mobility or Economic Indicators:** Regional purchasing power

## Modeling Paradigm

This is a **supervised regression problem** since the objective is to predict a numeric value (future demand). Historical demand serves as labeled data.

## Model Architecture

### Option A: Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost / LightGBM)

**Strengths:**
- Strong performance on structured tabular data
- Feature importance tracking (e.g., SHAP values)
- Low computational cost, fast training times

### Option B: Deep Temporal Models (LSTM / Temporal Fusion Transformer)

**Strengths:**
- Able to capture sequential and long-term dependencies
- Better suited for seasonality, trends, and abrupt changes
- Can model multiple time-dependent variables together

## Data Engineering Pipeline

Key components to feed reliable and context-aware inputs to the models:

- **ETL Workflow:** Extract, transform, and load sales and metadata
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Lag variables (last 7/30-day sales)
  - Rolling averages and seasonal flags
  - Binary indicators for holidays and promotions
  - Weather bucket encoding and regional aggregation
- **Categorical Encoding:** One-hot or target encoding for store type, region

## Model Evaluation Strategy

Proper evaluation ensures the model meets both statistical and business performance goals.

### Cross-Validation Methodology
- Time series cross-validation using sliding windows
- Prevents data leakage and simulates real-world rollout

### Key Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures average deviation
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Penalizes large prediction errors
- **Inventory Impact Score:** Custom business metric tracking cost of stockouts, overstock, and logistic shifts

## Prediction Serving Pipeline

A production-grade system will include:

- **Model Deployment:** REST API endpoints for accessing predictions
- **Batch Processing:** Daily or weekly predictions run at store-item level
- **Monitoring Dashboard:** Visualization for prediction anomalies and accuracy drift
- **Alert System:** Threshold-based triggers to flag unusual behaviors or missed forecasts

## Learning and Feedback Loop

- **Model Retraining:** Weekly cycles with latest transactional and external data
- **Inventory Feedback:** Use actual stocking outcomes as secondary labels
- **Concept Drift Detection:** Identify when behavior patterns shift over time

## Trade-Off Analysis

| Feature                     | Gradient Boosting                  | Deep Time-Series Models               |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Interpretability            | High (feature importance is clear) | Low (latent representations obscure)   |
| Training Speed              | Fast                                | Slower due to sequence complexity      |
| Temporal Pattern Handling   | Manual via feature engineering      | Natively learns complex patterns       |
| Infrastructure Requirements | Lightweight                         | Heavy (GPU, memory tuning required)    |
| Feature Engineering Effort  | High                                | Lower (model handles input dynamics)   |
| Flexibility Across Data     | Moderate                            | High adaptability                      |
| Business Integration        | Easier                              | May require additional tooling         |

## Extensions and Alternatives

- **Semi-Supervised Learning:** To use unlabeled data or incomplete demand signals
- **Unsupervised Techniques:** For detecting outliers, theft, or unexpected inventory losses
- **Online Learning Modules:** Incorporate continuous updates for real-time model adaptation
- **Federated Training Possibility:** If store-level data is siloed or privacy-protected
