# Module 3.1: Federated Learning â€“ Strategy, Applications, and Real-World Deployment

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept, workflow, and strategic role of Federated Learning (FL)
- Identify domains where FL addresses privacy, decentralization, and compute constraints
- Empower data scientists to evaluate FL as a deployment paradigm for sensitive data use cases

## What is Federated Learning?

Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that enables model training across multiple data sources without centralizing data. This is achieved by sending the model to each device or node, training locally, and aggregating learned updates.

### Key Principles
- **Privacy-first modeling:** Data never leaves its source
- **On-device intelligence:** Computation performed locally
- **Secure aggregation:** Model updates (not raw data) are sent to a central server

| **Aspect**          | **Benefits**                                        | **Trade-offs & Constraints**                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Privacy             | Retains local data, aligned with legal norms        | Limits access to full data context                         |
| Personalization     | Models adapt to user-level data distributions       | Risk of overfitting to local biases                        |
| Bandwidth Savings   | Sends light-weight updates                          | Frequent communication may still strain networks           |
| Decentralization    | Suits edge compute and remote silos                 | Requires robust client orchestration                       |
| Scalability         | Enables learning across thousands of nodes          | Aggregate convergence can be challenging                   |
| Security            | Avoids raw data leakage
