# Federated Learning – Strategy, Applications, and Real-World Deployment

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept, workflow, and strategic role of Federated Learning (FL)
- Identify domains where FL addresses privacy, decentralization, and compute constraints
- Empower data scientists to evaluate FL as a deployment paradigm for sensitive data use cases

## What is Federated Learning?

Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that enables model training across multiple data sources without centralizing data. This is achieved by sending the model to each device or node, training locally, and aggregating learned updates.

### Key Principles
- **Privacy-first modeling:** Data never leaves its source
- **On-device intelligence:** Computation performed locally
- **Secure aggregation:** Model updates (not raw data) are sent to a central server

| **Aspect**          | **Benefits**                                        | **Trade-offs & Constraints**                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Privacy             | Retains local data, aligned with legal norms        | Limits access to full data context                         |
| Personalization     | Models adapt to user-level data distributions       | Risk of overfitting to local biases                        |
| Bandwidth Savings   | Sends light-weight updates                          | Frequent communication may still strain networks           |
| Decentralization    | Suits edge compute and remote silos                 | Requires robust client orchestration                       |
| Scalability         | Enables learning across thousands of nodes          | Aggregate convergence can be challenging                   |
| Security            | Avoids raw data leakage

## Real-World Project Examples Using Federated Learning

### 1. Healthcare – Collaborative Tumor Detection

**Project Example**: [Owkin’s Federated Cancer Detection Model](https://research.aimultiple.com/federated-learning/)

**Scenario**: Multiple hospitals train models on their own patient imaging data (e.g., MRI scans) without sharing raw records.

**How It Works**:
- Each hospital trains a local model on its data.
- Only encrypted model updates are sent to a central server.
- The global model improves collaboratively while complying with HIPAA/GDPR.

**Why It Matters**:
- Enables small institutions to contribute to robust models.
- Avoids centralizing sensitive medical data.
- Improves diagnostic accuracy across diverse populations.

### 2. Mobile Systems – On-Device Personalization

**Project Example**: Google’s Gboard Keyboard

**Scenario**: Smartphones learn user typing behavior locally to improve autocorrect and suggestions.

**How It Works**:
- Lightweight models train on-device using keystroke data.
- Updates are sent to Google servers and aggregated.
- No raw text is uploaded.

**Why It Matters**:
- Preserves user privacy.
- Enables personalization at scale.
- Reduces latency and bandwidth usage.

### 3. Industrial IoT – Predictive Maintenance

**Project Example**: Siemens’ Federated Sensor Analytics

**Scenario**: Factories train models on local sensor data (e.g., vibration, temperature) to predict equipment failures.

**How It Works**:
- Each site trains a model on its own machinery data.
- Updates are aggregated to build a global predictive model.
- No proprietary sensor logs are shared.

**Why It Matters**:
- Protects intellectual property.
- Reduces downtime across facilities.
- Scales predictive analytics without centralizing data.
