# AI-Powered Medical Image Diagnosis Across Regional Clinics

## Problem Statement

A national healthcare provider wants to deploy an AI-based medical image diagnosis system across multiple regional clinics. Challenges include:

- Limited labeled data at each clinic
- Privacy restrictions that prohibit centralized data storage
- Variability in patient demographics and imaging hardware
- Diverse infrastructure (some clinics lack GPU support)

## Selected Machine Learning Paradigms

### 1. Transfer Learning
Utilizes pretrained image models (e.g., ResNet, ViT) to extract generic features and fine-tunes them on medical datasets with limited labeled X-ray images.

- **Purpose:** Leverage prior visual knowledge to improve generalization.
- **Model Type:** Fine-tuned convolutional networks or vision transformers.

### 2. Few-Shot Learning
Enables rapid adaptation to new clinics with very few labeled samples by embedding new examples and performing nearest-neighbor or prototype classification.

- **Purpose:** Handle sites with sparse or costly annotation pipelines.
- **Model Type:** Metric-based classifiers using embedding spaces.

### 3. Federated Learning
Distributes model training across clinics without sharing raw data. Each clinic locally trains its model and sends encrypted model updates to a central server.

- **Purpose:** Preserve privacy and enable collaborative learning.
- **Model Type:** Secure aggregation server + lightweight local training clients.
