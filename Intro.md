# Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning Paradigms

## Learning Objectives
- Define machine learning paradigms and their strategic importance
- Recognize how different paradigms affect model performance, data usage, and implementation feasibility

## Concept Overview
A machine learning paradigm represents the overarching strategy used for training models. Paradigm choice influences:
- Data requirements (labeled vs. unlabeled)
- Compute needs
- Scalability and generalization
- Privacy and data governance

Primary paradigms include:
- **Supervised Learning** – Uses labeled datasets to train models
- **Unsupervised Learning** – Explores patterns in unlabeled data
- **Self-supervised / Semi-supervised Learning** – Combines large-scale unlabeled data with a few labels
- **Transfer Learning** – Leverages pre-trained models for new tasks
- **Federated Learning** – Trains models across distributed datasets without centralized data access

## Strategic Significance
Selecting the right paradigm is critical to:
- Optimize cost and performance
- Address data constraints (availability, sensitivity, reliability)
- Align with deployment objectives (edge, centralized, privacy-preserving)

## Scenario Illustration
**Case: Recommendation System for E-commerce Platform**

Problem: Recommend products based on user history.

Considerations:
- Is labeled interaction data available?
- Can user data be aggregated centrally?
- Is real-time personalization required?

Decision Flow:
- If labeled clickstream data is available → Supervised Learning
- If clustering similar user behavior without labels → Unsupervised Learning
- If data resides on edge devices and must remain local → Federated Learning
- If only limited labeled data is available → Transfer or Semi-supervised Learning
